                <p>I am currently a rising senior at UC Berkeley, majoring in American Studies and minoring in Journalism. During my time at Cal, I've experiment with lots of different forms of media creation, eventually deciding to minor in Journalism in order to expand on my skills. I have interests in photography, videography, and long form storytelling, all of which I will showcase on this site.</p>
                <h2>Photography</h2>
                <p>I've been an amateur photographer for almost five years now; I started during my junior year of high school. I got started through photography class at my high school, taking the CP level junior year and the AP level senior year. Since then, I've been on the Daily Californian's photography staff, taken photos at Cal Athletics sporting events, and continued to learn more about creative composting. Below, I will highlight some of my favorites photos that I've taken over the years.</p>
                <img class="img-fluid d-block mx-auto" src="landscape1.jpg" alt="Sunset wih Boats"> 
                <p> </p>
                <img class="img-fluid d-block mx-auto" src="landscape2.JPG" alt="Beach in Morro Bay">
                <p> </p>
                <p>These two landscape photos were both taken in Morro Bay, but they were taken three years apart. The sunset photo was taken in 2016, and it was one of my first experiences trying long exposure. I didn't even have a tripod; I just set my camera down on a stair ledge! Still, this is one of my favorite photos I've taken because the colors are so vibrant and because the boats stand out so clearly.</p>
                <p>The other photo was taken in 2019 during Thanksgiving Break. I hadn't intended to take my camera to the beach that day, but suprisingly I came back with a lot of photos I was really happy with. I still love this one because of the small detail of the family on the left. Having a small detail like this that stands out in a photograph is often called a punctum, and I like the juxtaposition between this and the large rock on the right.</p>
                <img class="img-fluid d-block mx-auto" src="street1.jpg" alt="Cable Car"> 
                <p> </p>
                <img class="img-fluid d-block mx-auto" src="street2.jpg" alt="San Francisco">
                <p> </p>
                <p>These two photos were also taken in the same city years apart. I took the photo of the cable car in San Francsico in early 2016, and I took the black and white photo in early 2020 near the Ferry Building before the coronavirus pandemic. Street photography is always something I've wanted to dive into more, but in the past I've felt like I haven't had the time to explore it in the way I want to. I hope that as the world adapts to a new normal, I can find some time to document what street photography looks like now.</p>
                <p>The photo of the cable car was taken on a partly cloudy day, which helped with finding good lighting in the city. I didn't plan this shot much at all; it was just a random photo that I took and then realized later that I really liked it! The black and white photo was taken on a very foggy morning in February, so the haze in the background really contributes to the contrast in the buildings and the people walking in the street.</p>
                <img class="img-fluid d-block mx-auto" src="port1.jpg" alt="Looking Up"> 
                <p> </p>
                <img class="img-fluid d-block mx-auto" src="port2.jpg" alt="Falling Flowers">
                <p> </p>
                <p>The two photos were both created in 2019, when I went through a phase of loving creative composites. I started taking portraiture more seriously at the end of 2018, but I wanted to learn ways to make my portraits more interesting. I remember watching lots of editing tutorials on YouTube and spending hours on a single photo, but feeling very proud after finishing a photo I really liked. Now, I've been doing less compositing given my class workload and my desire to learn about new ways of storytelling. Still, reflecting on these photos makes me feel inspired and happy!</p>
                <p>The photo on the left is made up of three different photos. On the top and bottom, I used one photo of a snowy forest in Portland, Oregon. I added this photo twice, then transformed them so that they would mirror each other. The other two original photos in this composite are the silhouette of a friend of mine and a medium shot of a different forest in Portland.</p>
                <p>The photo on the right is not as intese of a composite, but I remember spending a lot of time getting the colors exactly the way I wanted. I also added in free transparent layers of flowers on top of the original portrait to reflect a bright and springtime mood.</p>

                <h2>Video Editing</h2>
                <p>At the beginning of my sophomore year at Cal, I got a part time job with Cal Athletics. I started working with the Branding and Creative team, which basically creates most of the video content for Cal Athletics social media. I had a lot to learn at first, given that I had no prior video experience, but I really enjoyed the process. Now, I'm about to complete my second year with the Branding Creative team, and I'm very happy with my experience. I've gotten to film and edit footage from so many different sports times and practice creating really engaging content. Below are some of my favorite videos that I've created for Cal Athletics.</p>

                <h2>Thousand Oaks: A Fujifilm Story</h2>
                <p>In quarantine this spring, I submitted an application on a whim to Fujifilm's Students of Storytelling program. To my surprise, I was accepted a couple months later! This program helps thirty students in total tell impactful stories through photography with Fujifilm equipment.</p>
                <p>My pitch for this program was a photography project about my hometown of Thousand Oaks, California. In November of 2018, Thousand Oaks experienced both a mass shooting and devastating wildfires, leaving the community heart broken. My photo series tells the stories of Thousand Oaks residents through the five stages of grief, showing how my hometown has healed and is still healing from these tragedies.</p>
                <p>In order to complete this project, I wanted to reach out to prominent members of Thousand Oaks communities to gather more perspectives about the shooting and fires than just my own. I ended up interviewing a firefighter, a local journalist, a father of one of the victims, and a few college students who had frequented the place of the mass shooting before. For some interviewees, I conducted socially distanced photoshoots to help tell their stories. Other interviewees did not want to be photographed, so instead of including photos below, I will attach audio files from our conversations. </p>
